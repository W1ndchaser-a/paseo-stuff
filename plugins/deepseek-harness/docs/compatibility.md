# ACP reasoning compatibility

## Current fork: 0.1.2 / Paseo 0.15.3

Native DSH context resume is unchanged. This fork additionally streams the v4
session store after a successful resume, preserves truthful tool states, and
surfaces degraded replay as a provider notice. Images use the private attachment
extension and an on-demand client renderer because the SDK's standard historical
user-message reducer only accepts text. History files are not cloned or rewritten.
The current SDK namespaces chunk IDs by kind; tests assert stable grouping and
separate reasoning/answer content rather than its internal ID representation.

## Historical reasoning fix

DSH's ACP bridge (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-acp`, `assistantUpdates`, still present in
0.1.7-rc.2 and 0.2.0-rc.1) sends a message's `agent_thought_chunk` and
`agent_message_chunk` with the same `messageId`. ACP v1
([Prompt Turn → Message IDs](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/prompt-turn))
says chunks with the same `messageId` belong to the same message, and a thought
and an answer are different messages. Paseo SDK 0.9.2 and 0.10.1 follow that
rule: [`resolveChunkId()`](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/blob/v0.10.1/packages/plugin/src/server/acp-internal/connection.ts#L922)
keys buffers by the explicit ID regardless of chunk kind, so the reasoning is
prepended to the answer. Reported upstream as
[deepseek-harness#8235](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/8235).

The bridge appends `:thought` only to nonempty string IDs on
`agent_thought_chunk` notifications. Assistant IDs, text, and other fields are
unchanged; missing, null, empty, or malformed IDs retain existing behavior.
ACP 1.4.0 defines `MessageId` as a string (`zMessageId = z.string()`), so the
suffix needs no UUID conversion. It assumes native DSH IDs do not occupy the
suffixed thought namespace; observed DSH message IDs are UUIDs. Remove the shim
once dsh-acp sends distinct IDs for thought and answer chunks.

Verified 2026-09-29 with synthetic ACP peers and the real `runAcpProvider()`:

- SDK 0.9.2: the nine tests in `server/reasoning.test.ts` went from eight
  failures plus the passing no-ID control to nine passes. Typecheck, lint,
  and the full suite pass (74 tests / 3 files).
- Installed Paseo 0.10.1 SDK: the same nine cases changed from eight failures
  to nine passes. For this isolated check, TypeScript was transpiled locally,
  the test registration import was changed from Vitest to `node:test`, and the
  SDK import targeted the app's bundled module. Electron's helper ran in Node
  mode.
- Cases cover exact `Thinking.` / `Answer.` separation, multiple chunks,
  thought/text interleaving with stable IDs, unchanged answer `messageId`,
  no-ID fallback grouping, native load, and the load-to-resume translation.
  History updates before load acknowledgment are checked at the bridge
  boundary; SDK integration checks turns after restore. DSH currently resumes
  without replay, and the SDK may drop pre-acknowledgment replay because it
  assigns its native session ID after the load response. This shim does not
  change that separate limitation or the SDK's grouping of interleaved blocks.

Live check, 2026-09-29: the installed plugin was reloaded from the fix on a
macOS Paseo 0.10.1 daemon, and one DSH turn ran with `deepseek-v4-flash`
(thinking High). In the hosted web client, the reasoning appeared only in the
collapsed Thinking block and the answer contained only the reply text. Mobile
was not checked. The shim does not repair host timeline items stored before
the fix. The plugin's minimum Paseo requirement is unchanged.
