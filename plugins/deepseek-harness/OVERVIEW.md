DeepSeek Harness adds a provider to Paseo so you can start agents that run through the official DeepSeek Harness command line tool (`dsh`) on the daemon machine. Paseo shows the conversation in its normal agent view, and the plugin has no screens of its own. It is a community plugin, not an official DeepSeek or Paseo product.

DeepSeek Harness must already be installed, logged in and configured on the daemon machine, with `dsh` on the daemon's `PATH`. The plugin refuses to start a session if `dsh --version` reports anything below 0.1.5-rc.1 or cannot be read. It also needs Paseo 0.8.0 or newer and Node.js 22.19.0 or newer on the daemon. The plugin does not install or configure `dsh` and does not read its credential files. The model and reasoning-effort choices come from the models `dsh` reports, so they follow your DeepSeek Harness setup.

Each agent session runs `dsh --profile acp` as a child process under your operating system user, with the daemon's environment plus the session's environment variables. Any credentials in that environment reach `dsh`, and the plugin adds no sandbox or permission policy of its own. `dsh` itself makes the calls to DeepSeek's service.

Resuming a session asks `dsh` to restore its own context. If that fails, the plugin reports the error and does not start a new session. Provider slash commands, steering and plans are not supported, and Paseo's extra system prompt is not passed to `dsh`. Listing models can leave empty sessions in the `dsh` session list.

Its automated checks pass with the Paseo 0.11.2 SDK and it loads on a 0.11.2 daemon on macOS. Windows and native iOS and Android clients are untested.
